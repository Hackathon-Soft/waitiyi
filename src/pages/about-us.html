                  Naseeha Institute was set up to bring us back to the Prophet’s life story and to realize our Quranic
                  identity. This identity begins with the Shahada but is an arduous journey of submission to our
                  Creator. Inspired by the Great Prophet Noahs Ark, each talk, workshop or course at Naseeha is part of
                  that larger journey in our life which takes us closer to our true purpose: submission to Allah. The
                  only ones who survived at the time of Prophet Noah were the ones who accompanied him on the boat
                  journey i.e. those in his Suhbat (companionship). Our mission at Naseeha is to bring back that system
                  of companionship created by Allah (SWT) for our tazkiya’a.

                  Our mission is to produce a generation of independent Islamic scholars and thinkers who are at the
                  same time working professionals contributing to society. Our team is committed to bridging the
                  disconnect between mainstream secular education and specialized Islamic studies curriculum being
                  taught at Madrassas. We expect our graduates to be active as role models in their communities,
                  respected both for their knowledge of religion and for the flexibility, realism, and independence of
                  mind with which they apply it. In this way, they can inspire others to combine the practice of Islam
                  with a positive concern to use their personal and professional skills for the benefit of the whole
                  society.

                  The journey of life keeps all of us perplexed as we encounter opportunities to do good & evil in
                  varying circumstances. Allahs love for His creation was manifested by sending Prophets which ended
                  with our Beloved Messenger Muhammad (PBUH). In just 23 years, Prophet Muhammad radically changed
                  everything around him & left the world a better place than when he had come into it. This is the story
                  of Islam. A story that began with our Prophet but continues to date with all of us. Living 1400 years
                  away from his time, we have forgotten the true purpose of our journey in this world.
